# deno-require

make deno *require* again (you don't need this, seriously)

instead, you should check out [pika.dev](https://pika.dev) and [jspm.io](https://jspm.io)
to look for dependencies you need. also look at [this post](https://denotutorials.net/migrating-your-npm-packages-to-deno.html)
for migration details

#### still here? alright, I'll give you what you want

see [require.ts](require.ts) for implementation details
